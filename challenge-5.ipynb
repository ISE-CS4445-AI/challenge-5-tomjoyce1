        "In this challenge, you will implement a simple RNN classifier using an LSTM cell for sentiment analysis on the YelpReviewPolarity dataset (a binary sentiment classification dataset).\n",
        "\n",
        "Your model should include:\n",
        "- An **Embedding** layer (with a specified `padding_idx`)\n",
        "- An **LSTM** layer (with `batch_first=True`)\n",
        "- A **Fully Connected (fc)** layer to map the final hidden state to the output\n",
        "- A **Sigmoid** activation to produce a probability between 0 and 1\n",

        "Your tasks are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing & DataLoader Setup** (2 points):  \n",
        "   Import the YelpReviewPolarity dataset, tokenize the text, build a vocabulary, and create a DataLoader to supply batches to your model.\n",

        "2. **RNNClassifier** (2 points):  \n",
        "   Implement a class that builds and returns the RNN classifier model using the parameters provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training and evaluating the model** (2 points):  \n",
        "   Implement a function that takes your model and trains it over a number of epochs and then tests it with sample yelp reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Q&A Section** (3 points total, 1 point each):  \n",
        "   Answer three questions (in markdown) about your implementation and key concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you are finished, the provided pytest tests at the end of this notebook will automatically evaluate your code.\n",

        "This challenge will <span style=\"color: red\">not work properly on Codespaces</span> because of the lack of GPU and pytorch support (at least I haven't figured out the setup yet). So for this challenge, you will open your repository's notebook in Google Collab and continue. You can do so by clicking the \"Open in Collab\" badge below and opening this notebook from your repository there.\n",
